                Hello! My name is Sana Ullah. I am a passionate and dedicated professional with expertise in multiple fields. I have completed my high school education and have developed a strong skill set in various technical and creative areas.

                I am a graphic designer with experience in Adobe software and Microsoft Office, including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of basic computer operations.
                
                As a web developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with other web technologies. I enjoy creating and designing websites, bringing ideas to life through clean and functional code.
                
                Besides my work in technology, I am also a skilled cabinet maker. I know how to design and build cabinets with precision and creativity, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics.
                
                I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I look forward to new opportunities where I can apply my knowledge and expertise.
